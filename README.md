# 🎭 Real-Time Emotion Detection with YOLOv8 and TensorFlow
This project implements a real-time emotion detection system using **YOLOv8** for face detection and **TensorFlow** (optional) for working with the FER-2013 dataset. The main feature of this app is its ability to detect human faces from a webcam feed and predict their emotional state in real time.
